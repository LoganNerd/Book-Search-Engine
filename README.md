# Book-Search-Engine
Creating a book search engine!

## Summary: 
In this challenge I started with starter code of a functional Book Search Engine and reafctored it to be an API built with GraphQL and Apollo Server. 

## Deployed App:

## Disclaimer:
This challenge was a serious headache. I was able to get the mutations and queries completed along with the auth and server additions but when it came time to test out my work, I ran into the same head scratching error everytime ("ApolloError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON"). I worked with TA's during office hours, 2 tutor sessions and they all said my code looked fine. Robby Kurle went out of his way, giving me an extra unscheduled hour (turned out to be around an hour and 40 minutes) to debug this thing. We ended up utilizing the App.js and Server.js (which is almost to the T exactly what I had) and also copied over the package.json from client side, server side, and main. The problem ended up being the outdated packages I had downloaded for react-router-dom, react-scripts, and some others.
